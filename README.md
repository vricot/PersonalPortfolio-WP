Hello and welcome to my personal portfolio website! Featured are all of my hobbies, interests, and freelance work! This site was created using HTML5, CSS3, some minor Bootstrap and Javascript, XAMPP, Local, and WordPress. This is the WordPress version of the initial local site, with DRY best practice.

This site is currently in the process of being deployed.
